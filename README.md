# Robin Records

Export trades through robinhood to a csv file. Works by parsing through emails from Robinhood.

This is my personal exporter for documenting trades on the Robinhood phone application. It's not completely finished, but i'm abonding it due to Robinhoods plans to release a web application and the documentation of the private Robinhood API which we can use to retrieve this information much easier. 

Working for gmail only currently, a bit of setup needed if anyone wishes to use it - send me a pm. 

I had much bigger plans for this, but it's not really worth the time anymore.
